# spotify-like-music-player
here i'm creating a web based music player with react and tailwind, that connects with your spotify account using the spotify api.
![player](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43221251/170255216-3f9d1622-f050-4512-9f25-f0cd640ea482.png)
First you need a device with the spotify running, than you can use this to control your spotify. It's possible to play, pause and control the volume.This will fetch from spotify api all of your playslists so you can play them.
As it is right now i need to manually whitelist new users in the spotify api, so unfortunately the vercel link will be broken util this changes (still possible to see to login page).

If cloning this repo, remember to create a new project in the spotify developers dashboard and configure it so you can run it.
